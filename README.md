## About

A website where the HTML content for any given request path is generated by GPT using the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/). Inspired by [LiveOverflow's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2uH6HnodlM) building something similar.

The application is deployed at [gpt.dtcristo.com](https://gpt.dtcristo.com/) but it is protected by HTTP Basic authentication. Please contact me directly if you want the credentials to try it out. Otherwise, get your own OpenAI API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/) and run it yourself.

## Usage

Requires a Ruby environment, tested with Ruby 3.2.

```sh
# Set OpenAI API key as environment variable.
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Install dependencies.
bundle install

# Start the web server.
bundle exec puma
```

Application live at [localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292/).
